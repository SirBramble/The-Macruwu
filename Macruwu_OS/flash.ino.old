/* This example demo how to expose on-board external Flash as USB Mass Storage.
 * Following library is required
 *   - Adafruit_SPIFlash https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash
 *   - SdFat https://github.com/adafruit/SdFat
 *
 * Note: Adafruit fork of SdFat enabled ENABLE_EXTENDED_TRANSFER_CLASS and FAT12_SUPPORT
 * in SdFatConfig.h, which is needed to run SdFat on external flash. You can use original
 * SdFat library and manually change those macros
 *
 * Note2: If your flash is not formatted as FAT12 previously, you could format it using
 * follow sketch https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash/tree/master/examples/SdFat_format
