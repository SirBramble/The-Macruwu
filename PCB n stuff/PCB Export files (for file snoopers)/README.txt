This stuff was created by the EasyEDA export tools. They are SHIT. And I mean realy SHIT! Most files are glitchy and the only things that work well, are the Gerber files.
Well, at least something. But if you want to snoop arround the exported stuff, feel free. If it helps, even better.

Edit: I tried getting the PCB converted to kicad, but it did not work as intended. Like I said, the EasyEDA exports are bricked.
There is a V2 in the works, created with kicad, but this will still take some time.
I exported the EasyEDA project files as json files, so you can at least check out the PCB within EasyEDA.
