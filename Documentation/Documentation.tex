	\section{Motivation}
	My Handwriting is shit. And I mean really shit. My teachers gave me a lot of shit for it too, often deducting grades for it. So when I went to uni, I started taking notes digitally. First I tried my luck with OneNote and a digital pen, hoping somehow it would improve my notetaking-ability. But when that inevitably failed, I switched to Word. For those, who have never tried, writing equations in Word is a pain in the rear side. It takes ages and especially when equations get more complex, its a nightmare to try and get the $e^{x}$ to go, where you want it to go.\\
	So I switched once more. My choice fell on Markdown with inline $L^AT_EX$. Markdown is a Markup Language that can easily run in a browser and like $L^AT_EX$ it's "what you mean is what you get". It has easy syntax, making it easy to learn, but also supports inline $L^AT_EX$, which is very useful when writing equations. The hoster we (my friends and I) use also supports multiple people working on the same document in real time, which makes taking notes a lot faster and also allows for one person to be sketching graphs and such, while the rest of us try our best to keep up with the professor.\\
	But even with Markdown and multiple people writing at the same time, it just took to long and we sometimes missed some important notes.\\

		\caption{Macropad v0.1}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	\noindent So one afternoon I botched together my first macro pad out of some cherry switches and a teensy I had lying around. It was extremely botched and had no fancy features to speak of, but it worked. That got me hooked. Even with just 8 extra keys, I was able to write a lot faster. So I went back to the drawing board and started designing what was to become the Macruwu.
	\section{Requirements}
	For this macropad to be of use to me, it needed to fulfil certain requirements.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It needed to be compatible with any system. This meant, it needed to work, no matter what computer I plugged it in to. This also meant, I could not rely on any Software, that had to be running in the background.
		\item It should be able to type out any key combination that would also be possible on a normal keyboard. This would make it universally useable for nearly any software, because nearly any software can be controlled easily with shortcuts from a keyboard.
		\item It should not hinder my workflow. This means, that using the Macruwu should always be faster than typing out the command or character strings by hand.
		\item It needed to be fast. I wanted as little a delay as I could get, so that long strings of characters could be printed fast. For complex equation presets a maximum delay of about 300-400ms would be optimal.
		\item Mappings should be changeable on the fly. If for example a certain equation were to show up consistently in class, it should be easy and fast to bind that equation to a key.
		\item It should be expandable. If 32 Keys isn´t enough or I want to add some kind of other interface device or expansion module it should be possible to interface it with the Macruwu.
		\item It needs RGB. I could try and think up some reason for the necessity of RGB, but I just want RGB uwu.
		\item It should be affordable. The goal for this project was to stay under 70€ per unit.
		\item It should be repairable. For me this meant, leaving options for most kinds of mechanical keyswitches. If a switch breaks, or I want to change them out later, it should be easy to just rip ´em out and stick in a new one.
	\end{itemize}
	\newpage
	\section{Material choices}
	\subsection{Microcontroller}
	For the Microcontroller, I chose the seeed studio RP2040. It´s a small board, even smaller, than a teensy, but allows you to configure it as a HID with very little effort. It´s also very fast and has a humongous 2MB of flash, which can also be configured as a mountable flash drive. It doesn´t have a lot of pins, but it breaks out 2 I$^2$C Lines, a SPI Bus and even UART, if you need it. And USB-C is just the cherry on top.\newline
	If you want to learn more, you can check out the \href{https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040/}{seeed Wiki}. This is good to get you started with the Microcontroller, but if you want more information on the Programming side, you should check out Earle Philhowers arduino pico \href{https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico}{github} and \href{https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{documentation}.
	
	\subsection{I/O expanders}
	In order to read the keyswitch inputs some kind of I/O expander was needed. I just went for the cheapest I could find on Mouser that was still in Stock. It turned out to be the \href{https://www.mouser.de/datasheet/2/302/PCA9555-1127545.pdf}{PCA9555D}, a double 8-Bit I/O expander that can be read via I$^2$C. It offers internal pull-up resistors, which was a nice bonus, meaning I didn´t have to add them to the design. However, keep in mind that you may have to add some to your design, if you with to use a different I/O expander.
	
	\subsection{Level shifter}
	The RP2040 is a 3.3V microcontroller. In order to use 5V Logic devices, a level shifter is needed. This is however optional. If you don´t plan on using the neopixels or 5V I$^2$C devices, you can just leave it out. At first I used the \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/txu0104}{TXU0104PWR} which is a unidirectional chip. This works great for the neopixels, but will not work for the 5V I$^2$C due to this being a bidirectional protocol. However Texas Instruments offers a pin-equivalent bi-directional chip, the \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lsf0204-q1}{LSF0204-Q1}. I haven't tested it so far, but the datasheet indicates that this should be a drop in replacement.
	
	\subsection{RGB goodness}
	In order to fulfil my endless need for funny blinky lights, I picked up some \href{https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003636607308.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.23.22bf5c5fJNwVec&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu}{SK6803 MINI-Es} from aliexpress. They come in 3mA and 12mA versions. In order to not over strain the USB Power, I would recommend getting the 3mA version. They should be more than bright enough. If you want to burn out your retinas, you can also go for the 12mA version, but keep in mind, that you may run into Voltage drops when running them at the full 12mA.\newline
	One of the most useful features of the SK6803 MINI-Es is their ability to be mounted through a cutout in the PCB, making them sit flush with the surface. This allows the use of most switches. They also have a identical addressing scheme to standard neopixels and can be controlled with for example the Adafruit Neopixel library.
	
	\subsection{Hot-swap sockets}
	In order to change Keyswitches without having to solder, some sort of hot-swap socket is needed. I chose the \href{https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/parts/49/kailh-hotswap-pcb-sockets-10-pcs?c=11}{Kailh hot-swap sockets}. They´re easy to solder and work a lot better than the press in ones, you may find on commercial hot-swap boards. They also come in versions for MX and choc style keyswitches.
	
	\subsection{Keyswitches}
	This is purely preference. I love clicky keys, so I went for the clickiest (reasonably priced) keys I could find. The \href{https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32980039972.html}{Gateron greens} are a very affordable option for MX style keys and are quite clicky. If you want maximum click for a bit more cash, you can check out the \href{https://keycapsss.com/switchestester/switches/65/kailh-low-profile-choc-switches?c=9}{Kailh whites}. They provide maximum click, guaranteed to annoy the living heck out of most sane people. So I absolutely love them.\newline
	If you prefer not so make everyone in a 30Km radius go insane, you can also choose a tactile or linear switch. Both the Gateron and Kailh keys offer those options. If you want to fall in to a very deep rabbit hole, you can also look up Keyswitches on YouTube. Trust me, it´s worth it.
	
	\subsection{Keycaps}
	Now here there are several options. You can 3D-print your keycaps on a resin printer or print flat ones on a FDM printer and label them after. You can get quite creative with custom keycaps. If you don´t want to print your own, \href{https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005003047698548.html}{relegendable keycaps} are always a option and the one I went for. A printable template for the keycap inlays is in the main GitHub repository.
	
	\subsection{I$^2$C Jacks}
	In order to connect the Macruwu to other Input devices I used a \href{https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/parts/54/2x-trrs-jacks-3.5mm?c=11}{3.5mm 4-pin headphone jack}. This provides 3.3V, GND, SCL, SDA and offers the option to use a wide variety of fancy cables.

	\subsection{Soldering tips}
	SMD Soldering is a pain, but in this case necessary. if you have never soldered SMD before or it´s been a while, here are some tips:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Start with the smallest components. I would recommend starting with the SMD capacitors. They are really fiddly, but are good for practice, especially if you haven´t soldered SMD before. If you mess up, they are also easy to remove letting you try again. And if you manage to solder all the capacitors, the rest should not be a problem.\newline
		\textbf{NOTE:} When soldering the capacitors, leave out the ones at the ICs and do them later. They might get in the way of soldering the ICs in.
		\item When soldering the ICs, start by tinning a single pad. Once you have tinned one Pad, heat it up and push the IC in to place. Then you can solder the rest of the connections.
		\item Use flux. It´s not strictly necessary, but it does help a lot, especially when using lead free solder. If you find yourself getting a lot of bridges or cold solder joints, give flux a try. It does help a lot. I personally use \href{https://www.amazon.de/FELDER-L%C3%B6tfett-L%C3%B6tmittel-Solder-L%C3%B6tpaste/dp/B01822CUO6}{flux paste you get in those small tins}, but any flux is better than none.
		\item Have some solder wick lying around. If you find yourself not being able to separate a bridge on an IC, you will want solder wick. Ideally apply some flux to the wick, place it on the solder joints you want to disconnect and press your soldering iron on top. This should pull unnecessary solder in to the wick.\newline
		\textbf{NOTE:} Do not pull the solder wick around the connection or PCB. This will scrape away the solder mask and may expose or cut traces. Found that out the hard way...
		\item When soldering in the hot-swap sockets and RGB LEDs, make sure they are properly soldered to the board. Especially ground pads tend to result in cold solder joints. Use Flux and check your connections with a multimeter. For the Hot-swap sockets you can increase the Temperature to about 370-400°C, but try not to keep the iron on there for to long if you do. For the LEDs I would recommend not going above 360°C, because they might break. Haven´t had that happen before, but keep this in mind.
		\item Clean your board after soldering. You can use isopropanol or similar non conducting cleaning liquids. This is to prevent corrosion and general stickiness from the flux.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Macruwu Firmware}
	The Firmware is based on Earle Philhowers \href{https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico}{arudino pico} and includes some Adafruit librarys. So make sure to install them before trying to run this code.
	\subsection{Structure}
	\textbf{NOTE:} I´m not studying computer science, so this diagram may not be up to standard. But I hope it gives a slight overview of how the Code is structured. This will be updated with code updates. (hopefully)\newline
	\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
		\centering
		\resizebox{0.5\textheight}{!}{\input{Classes/Keyboard}}
	\end{minipage}
	\newline
	\newline
	The basic Idea of this code, is to divide everything up in to separate Modules, that interface with each other. This needs a bit more effort, to try and get the separate modules working together, but once set up, is a lot easier to tweak.
	\subsubsection{'Layer' class}
	So, lets go over the structure and start at the bottom. The 'Layer' class has a vector of Strings. This stores all the plaintext commands associated with a cirtain button. So a 'Layer'-object has several buttons.
	\subsubsection{'Keymap' class}
	The 'Keymap' class has a vector of 'Layer's. So a 'Keymap'-object has several Layers consisting of several buttons. You can imagine this as an array or a table, that allows you to look up what command is associated with a cirtain button on a cirtain layer.
	\subsubsection{'Filesystem' functions}
	The 'Keymap' class can also access the Filesystem with the 'import()' method. This method pulls the command strings from the 'macroLayout.txt' stored on the internal filesystem and saves them in the aforementioned 'Layer-Button'-structure.
	\subsubsection{'Keyboard' class}
	This construct is then controlled by the 'Keyboard'-class. This builds a interface for the 'main' to access but also introduces some of its own functionality. The 'Keyboard'-class manages all the HID(Human interface device)-commands and also houses the interpreter to convert the command strings to sendable HID key-codes. This is done internally for the most part, but exposes all the relevant interface methods to the main. For example the 'interpret(layer, button)'-method interprets and runs the command stored in the command string at the given layer and button as a HID command.\newline
	\textbf{NOTE:} All HID commands are set to work with a German keyboard layout. Most of them still work with a US or similar layout, but you might have to change some special character key-codes like '\verb=^=' or '\verb=\='.\newline
	There are also other methods included in the class. The 'readFile()'-method in combination with the 'fsChanged()'-method can auto-update the 'Layer-Button'-structure from the 'macroLayout.txt'-file whenever the file is edited.
	\subsubsection{'noepixel' functions}
	So far not a lot has been done here. These are just some function prototypes, saved in a separate file. 'neopixelSetup()' just initialises the Adafruit library and 'testNeopixel()' just runs a slow rainbow-effect.
	\subsubsection{'Expander' class}
	The 'Expander'-class is responsible for reading and debouncing the I/O expanders. The state of any pin on the I/O expander can be accessed via the 'getState' method.
	\subsubsection{'Mapping' module}
	This is not shown in the diagram and is mainly for debugging and testing. The 'Mapping' module a header and source file combination that creates its own 'Keyboard' object and runs hardcoded sets of instructions, when a button is pressed. The function of a cirtain button can be called in the main via the 'action(button)' function.
	\subsection{AniMacro}
	The AniMacro scripting language (kinda) is used to tell the Macropad what to type from the 'macroLayout.txt'. This is fully customisable and you can add your own commands in the 'Keyboard::interpret()' method if you are so inclined.\\
	The basic structure however is set by the 'readFile()' method. With 'Layer x:' you set the current layer to x. Follow that with 'Button y: something' and you set button 'y' on layer 'x' to 'something'. Every 'Layer x:' or 'Button y: something' must be followed by a linebreak.\newline
	\textbf{For example:}\newline
	\noindent\fbox{%
		\parbox{\textwidth}{%
			\begin{tabbing}
				Layer 1:\= \\
				\> Button 1: something \\
				\> Button 2: something else \\
				Layer 2:\\
				\> Button 1: something on Layer 2
			\end{tabbing}
		}%
	}\newline
	\subsubsection{Implemented commands}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|m{6.5cm}|m{6.5cm}}
		\hline
		\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Comment}\\
		\hline
		\hline
		\verb=some text= & No operator prints plain text& \\
		\hline
		\verb=\plain{}= & Prints contents as plain text. Can print characters reserved for AniMacro commands. & Double Brackets \verb={}= will be printed. If the have contents (e.g. \verb={a}=), the plain command chain is broken and returned to the 'no Operator' state.\\
		\hline 
		\verb=<= & Moves screen cursor one step to the left (presses left arrow key) & \\
		\verb=>= & Moves screen cursor one step to the right (presses right arrow key) & \\
		\verb=\n= & Triggers the 'ENTER'-key & \\
		\verb=\t= & Triggers the 'TAB'-key & \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}\\\\
	Most special characters can also be typed without a special command:\\
	\verb=\ ^ { } [ ] ( ) $ | _ . ,=
	\section{Debugging tips}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{debugging}
		\caption{Debugging tips from the IT crowd}
	\end{figure}
	Sometimes the Macruwu gets stuck and cant get out (of an infinite loop or something). Unplugging it and plugging it back in again can help with that and works in 90\% of all cases.\\
	If this does not help, try the tips below.
	\subsection{Compiling firmware}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Check weather you have the correct version of the arduino pico framework installed. I used the newest at the time, which was version 2.6.4.
		\item Also check, that you have the correct librarys installed.
		\subitem Adafruit NeoPixel by Adafruit (1.10.6)
		\subitem Adafruit SPIFlash by Adafruit (4.0.0)
		\subitem SdFat - Adafruit Fork by Bill Greiman (2.2.1)
		\item If you are using Platform I/O or similar, you may have to include files other than the main separately in the compiler config
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Microcontroller crashing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Try running the 'flash\_test()' function in the setup. This will create the 'macroLayout.txt' which if missing might cause the microcontroller to crash.
		\item If the microcontroller doesn't get recognised by the computer, try holding dowm the 'BOOT' button on the and while pressing it, plug the microcontroller back in to the computer. It will them show up as a new device, and COM port and you should be able to upload to it.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Filesystem corrupted}
	This can happen, if the 'File read' protocol crashed, due to a illegal character in the 'macroLayout.txt' file on the flash. If this happens, please open a issue with the character, that caused the crash.\\
	There is a way to 'restore' it though.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Unplug the Macruwu and uncomment the 'flash\_clear()' command. This will clear the flash partition.
		\item Hold the 'BOOT' button (the on on the right) on the RP2040 and plug it in while pressing the button. This will manually set the microcontroller in to programming mode.
		\item Select the newly appeared COM port and press upload. You may have to restart the Arduino IDE several times throughout this process, if it is stuck in a infinite upload loop. Don´t worry, this will not break anything.
		\item Once uploaded, a new drive should show up. If you are under Windows you will be prompted to format the disc.
		\item Once formatted, you can upload a backup of the 'macroLayout.txt' or create a new one. DO NOT UNPLUG THE MACRUWU!
		\item Go to the Arduino IDE and comment or delete the 'flash\_clear()' command.
		\item Select the correct COM port and press upload. If the Arduino IDE is stuck in a infinite upload loop, restart the IDE. 
		\item It should be working normally again.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Neopixels not working}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Check the solder connections. If the Neopixels are not properly soldered on to the pads they will not work. Even one improperly soldered Neopixel may cause the others to act funny. I recommend checking each connection with a multimeter, by connecting one probe to $GND$ or $5V$ respectively and going through the respective pins on the Neopixels with the other.
		\item If $5V$ and $GND$ are connected correctly, but you are still having trouble, check the connection between the Neopixels. $D_{out}$ of one and $D_{in}$ of the next in the chain should always be connected.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{I/O expanders not working}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Check the solder connections
		\item Make sure your I/O Expanders have internal pull-up resistors. If they do not, they will not work with the Macruwu board. If you have your own board, you can also add them on the PCB, however, I did not do that with mine.
		\item Make sure you have set the correct address. The Base address can be found in the datasheet of the I/O expander and the variable address pars can be found in the Macruwu schematic. If you are using the same I/O listed in the materials section, the preset address should be correct.
		\item If you are using different I/O expanders from the ones listed in the materials section, make sure the I$^2$C addressing scheme is correct. Other I/O expanders may need to be configured differently from the ones I used. If it turns out that you do need a setup sequence for your I/O expanders, you can create a 'init()' method in the 'Expander' class and call it in the setup.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{some buttons are not being recognised}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Check the solder connections on the hot-swap sockets. They tend to form cold solder joints, that you may not always see. Especially the GND pad tends to do this. Check the connection with a multimeter by holding one probe to a known GND and going through the other connections with the other probe. The same can be done for the other side of the socket. Hold one probe on the socket and the other on the corresponding I/O expander pin.
		\item Make sure the key switch is installed correctly. The pins do tend to bend when pressing them in. you can check from the underside of the board, if the pin is seated in the hot-swap socket. If not, pull it out, straighten out the pin with a pair of pliers and press it back in.
	\end{itemize}
